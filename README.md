I built this as one of the front-end library projects for [freeCodeCamp], which is a fantastic online learning community for web development.

My goals for building this app included the following:

- Practice building a React/Redux app
- Start using ESLint
- Practice unit testing with Jest & Enzyme
- Learning how to make a dragbar to dynamically resize divs
- Improving my CSS skills, specifically CSS Flexbox, variables, and the position property
- Practice wireframing and thinking through user stories before jumping right into coding

Here are my original sketches of what I envisioned this app to look like (So far I've implemented just the desktop version)!

</p>

Some of the key user stories I aimed to implement included:

- A dragbar that dynamically resized divs
- Several pre-built templates/options, such as a Markdown reference, Git cheat sheet, and README template (I wanted to add practicality to this app by including pre-built templates I would reference in the future)
- Themes with various background images and color schemes

## Lessons Learned

One of my primary goals for each freeCodeCamp project and set of challenges is to learn about new web development concepts and practice my programming skills.

Here are a few <em>new concepts</em> I learned and practiced by creating this React + Redux app:

- ESLint and Prettier
- Creating a dragbar to dynamically resize HTML elements
- State management with Redux
- Separating presentational and container components in React
- Updating CSS variables with JavaScript based on the state of a React application
- Markdown purpose and syntax
- CSS Flexbox

## Technologies Used
