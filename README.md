# Markdown Previewer

I am in the process of building a markdown previewer with React and Redux.

</p>

I'm building this markdown previewer for a few reasons. First, it's one of the front-end library projects for <a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer">freeCodeCamp</a>, which is a fantastic online learning community for web development. 

Second, this markdown previewer will include several built-in templates accessible via a drop-down button, including a Markdown quick reference, a git cheat sheet, a README template, and this repository's README. When I build personal projects for online courses like this, I like to add a personal touch and modify them so I can get practical usage from them. By adding templates that I can reference in the future, I'll be building a project that will solve an actual problem I face. 

My third reason for building this project is to gain more experience using new web development technologies. Specifically, in this project I want to incorporate the following technologies and figure out how to solve the following problems:

* React & Redux
* ESLint
* Unit Testing with Jest & Enzyme
* Media queries for responsiveness based on device width (i.e., desktop, tablet, mobile)
* Making a dragbar to resize divs
* Button to copy text to a clipboard 
* Using CSS to add scrollbars to the side of divs

Additional User Stories:

* Themes with semi-transparent background images and different color schemes

## About

## Lessons Learned

One of my primary goals for each freeCodeCamp project and set of challenges is to learn about new web development concepts and practice my programming skills.

Here are a few <em>new concepts</em> I learned and practiced by creating this React + Redux app:
